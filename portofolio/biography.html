                    <h5>Developer and Designer</h5>
                    <p>I am Bethemariam Asrat, born in August 1, 2000. Bahir Dar is where I was born and raised.
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am pursuing my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering at Bahir Dar University, 
                    which is one of the largest universities in the country.I am always been passionate about technology and its applications. I have a strong desire to learn 
                     and constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of software engineering.
                     As a software engineering student I worked on some projects for internship program and final year project, using Django and Flutter frameworks.
                    After I graduate,I want to work mostly as a mobile app developer and data analyst.
                    In addition to programming, I am a well-rounded individual who enjoys reading books, designing bags and loves to explore new places and cultures.
                    I have desire to make a positive impact on the world, and I believe that software engineering is a powerful tool 
                    that can be used to solve complex problems and improve people's lives.
